2. **CVE Name:** CVE-2023-20238

3. **CVSS Score:** 
   - NVD has not yet provided a score.
   - CNA (Cisco Systems, Inc.) Base Score: 10.0 CRITICAL

4. **Description:** 
   - A vulnerability in the single sign-on (SSO) implementation of Cisco BroadWorks Application Delivery Platform and Cisco BroadWorks Xtended Services Platform could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to forge the credentials required to access an affected system. This vulnerability arises from the method used to validate SSO tokens. An attacker could exploit this by authenticating to the application with forged credentials. Successful exploitation could let the attacker commit toll fraud or execute commands at the privilege level of the forged account. If the account is an Administrator account, the attacker could view confidential information, modify customer settings, or change settings for other users. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need a valid user ID associated with an affected Cisco BroadWorks system.

5. **Attack Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
	
	AV:N (Attack Vector: Network)
	AC:L (Attack Complexity: Low)
	PR:N (Privileges Required: None)
	UI:N (User Interaction: None)
	S:C (Scope: Changed)
	C:H (Confidentiality Impact: High)
	I:H (Integrity Impact: High)
	A:H (Availability Impact: High)	
	

6. **Requires Credentials:** Yes (the attacker would need a valid user ID associated with an affected Cisco BroadWorks system)

7. **Attack difficulty level:** Not explicitly mentioned, but given the high CVSS score, it can be inferred that the difficulty might be low.

8. **Impact:** CRITICAL (based on the CNA score of 10.0)

9. **Exploited in the Wild:** Not mentioned.

10. **Patch available / Remediation:** Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds available to mitigate this vulnerability. Customers with service contracts are advised to obtain security fixes through their usual update channels. Those without service contracts should contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center.

11. **Workaround Available:** No

12. **POC:** No

13. **Extra notes:** The vulnerability is currently awaiting further analysis. The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability. The vulnerability was discovered during Cisco's internal security testing.
